# Online_Music_Player
This project allows users to play background music tracks directly from YouTube. The player dynamically updates the album cover, track title, and embedded YouTube video when a user clicks a button. Additionally, the project includes embedded UI designs from Figma and Adobe XD to showcase the planned interface and user experience.
